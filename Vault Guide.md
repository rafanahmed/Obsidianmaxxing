## Folder Structure

### 1. Personal
_Private reflections, not for public eyes._

- Not tracked in Git (excluded via `.gitignore`)
- Journals, affirmations, trackers, and personal to-do lists
- Fully private: internal thoughts, life documentation, goals

---

### 2. Academia
_Anything I study — whether it’s for school or out of passion._

- University course notes
- Academic material studied independently (e.g., physics, math, CS, literature)
- Textbook summaries, research notes, lecture highlights

---

### 3. Grind
_Work that builds toward a career — tech jobs, startups, and big ideas._

- Internship and tech job documentation
- Programming projects (code + theory)
- Startup brainstorming and notes
- Productivity tools, system design, monetization plans

---

### 4. Gnosis
_Everything that excites me — not because I have to know it, but because I want to._

- Religious/philosophical exploration
- Music, poetry, art, and creative notes
- Interesting YouTube videos (e.g., recommended videos, essays, documentaries)
- Any personal curiosities that don’t fit academia or grind
